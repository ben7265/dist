Getting Started
---------------

1. There is a quick start guide in docs folder and code for a demo system. You can download this on any Windows Server and try out the demo based on the quick start guide. Currently this is a beta internal release only so detailed Developer Guides and Reference Manual would be available when the new release is done.
2. For any IT services companies or developers who would like to learn WXML or use this in their projects in the meantime can send or post a message. We have free training programs to train companies or developers on Wohola X development.

What is Wohola X?
-----------------

1. Wohola X is an enterprise grade solution for developing large scale web based solutions quickly and easily. It can be configured to handle websites of any size, scale or traffic. 
2. Wohola X scales automatically based on server capability. There is no need for external software or any coding for the same. It has a very small footprint, very small code base and fast page processing times so even without any additional configuration it can handle large loads on relatively smaller servers.
3. Wohola X is the tenth version of Wohola, a long running platform. WX was written from scratch and has been developed with the mindset that one solution should fit all and should take care of potentially ALL problems faced in their web based solutions by developers, managers, testers, server or database administrators, site administrators, users and companies.
4. The development in WX is done with WXML a programming language designed specifically for Wohola X coding. It is an enhanced version of HTML so HTML/CSS developers can build most of the solution without knowledge of other programming languages, technical platforms, databases or software architecture. WXML is unique in the sense that the core language can be enhanced easily by anyone. Normally in other platforms it is possible to build libraries but the core language stays the same. In WXML the core language itself can be enhanced as per needs of any project or as per desire of any developer.
5. WX manages most of the technical complexity automatically under the covers. WX also handles most database and back-end functions automatically so WXML developers only need HTML/CSS skills in general. Anything that is not already implemented can be implemented using javascript so there is no limitation on what can be done.
6. WX can handle any software development requirements. Since the underlying platform is normal HTML/CSS and Javascript which means anything that can be done on any technical platform can be done on WX. There are no limitations other that what is possible to be done with any other language or technology.
7. Since it is designed to be a one solution fits all model for web based solutions, we are targeting Wohola X as an alternative for not only development platforms like React, Angular, Laravel, Symphony, Django, Bootstrap, jQuery and other such platforms, but also as an alternative to CMS systems like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal etc. Going one step further we plan to take Wohola X to a stage where it could be seen as viable alternative to ERP systems like SAP or MS Dynamics.
8. The UI in Wohola X is WYSIWYG enabled, so it is easy to develop as there is no need to build additional administrative screens and solutions built on Wohola X are easy to administer as the site administrators can simply click on the item they see on the page and change it instead of having to sift through menu items and pages in admin panels.
9. The future roadmap includes voice to wxml where someone can simply give requirements in natural language like a normal customer would give with that as input the whole solution becomes ready.

Summary Advantages
------------------

1. For typical WX projects, for most of the work you do not need
- Database developers and adminstrators
- Software architects
- Backend developers
- Server administrators
- Developers with skills in technologies like PHP, Python, Node.js, Angular, React etc
- Developers to build admin panels for managing site data
2. Majority of the work that is done by such developers is managed automatically by WX
3. Project can be done with a smaller team of HTML/CSS developers instead of needing a bigger team of developer with knowledge of PHP, Python, Node.js, Angular, React etc
4. For most work you only need developers with prior knowledge of HTML and CSS
5. New features can be built by developers with knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript only
6. Any non-technical person can manage the site by clicking on the page and editing images, text etc directly on page
7. Wohola X has security, scalability features in built.

Detailed Advantages
-------------------

1. WX uses WXML (Wohola X Markkup Language or Wohola XML) an enhanced version of HTML/CSS so developers with HTML/CSS can do most of the project developement. There is no need for developers to have skills in PHP, Python, Node.js or other such technologies.
2. There is no need for knowledge of databases, backend code for WXML developers. They only define what the objects look like on the screen. How to save and retrieve data is managed automatically by WX. So there is no need for backend or database developers and database administrators.
3. WX has its own internal architecture which is scalable, extensible and delployment ready, so there is no need for software architects.
4. WX has WYSIWYG interface which allows for easy editing directly on screen, so there is no need to have developers to build screens for admin panel.
5. WX has simple configuration. It only requires the administrator to know how to manage DNS A and CNAME records and how to open and block ports on firewall. So with 10-15 minutes of easy learning any HTML/CSS developer or non-technical person can manage the server, so there is no need to have server administrators.
6. WX scales automatically based on available hardware resources, so there is no need for any technical resources for scaling the solution for larger workloads.
7. WX can be enhanced by writing XTENs which use HTML/CSS and Javascript, so any new features which are currently not in WX can be built so WX can handle any business requirements.
9. WXML has capabililty to define new HTML tags (XTENs) which encapsulate all the capabilities of that tag within itself, including HTML, CSS, fron-end Javascript, Backend Code. So it is easy to develop and maintain.
10. In general WX projects only require HTML/CSS skills for the project work and developers with some knowledge of Javascript in the event some feature is required which does not exist in WX. Typically custom development with WX should take a smaller team of HTML/CSS developers and 10% of team having some knowlegde of Javascript, instead of a larger team of developers working in React, Angular, Node.js, mongoDB, Python, PHP, Laravel or other such technologies.
11. WX uses Cloudflare DNS, so there is no need to purchase and install SSL. It comes with Cloudflare automatically.
12. Cloudflare DNS also has a CDN so the site runs fast around the world.
13. WX has inbuilt role based authentication. Cloudflare provides another security layer. WX sends encrypted keys to browser which are used by WX for any server transactions. So WX provides an enterprise grade security. However, WX can work without Cloudflare.
14. WX is a webserver it itself, so there is no need for IIS, Apache or Nginx web server for running WX solutions. However, if those webservers are there WX can work with them.
15. WX can be configured to work with clustered MongoDB setup so it can handle sites with large traffic or big databases.
16. WX has IT services companies as Wohola Solution Providers or Wohola Partners which are already using WX and have skills to handle WX projects. So there is a community of WXML developers that exists and it would continue to grow.

Notes for Enterprises
---------------------
1. WX scales automatically based on server resources. It can also be configured to run on server farms for large deployments. The choice of server is Windows as per WX policy of ease of use so smaller deployments can manage the WX deployment by training normal Windows users. On the other hand for larger enterprises who have skilled resources available for managing Linux deployment can opt for Linux option.
2. WX can work with mongodb master slave configuration out of the box, and can be customized to work with shards so it can handle very large volumes of data.
3. WX can integrate with any third party system that allows integration.
4. For large chunks of repetitive code custom WXML translaters can be created to automatically generate code from simple to manage WXML files. A typical example would be a backedn server built on Java Springboot API. It uses complex setup requiring expensive skilled resources who primarily repeat similar code patterns. Most of the code generation for such type of systems can be generated by custom WX to Java tranlaters. In this example the output would be perfect Java code that a human developer would have normally written without the mistakes the human would have made. Once done further enhancements and customizations could then be easily managed by semi-technical people with ability to read and modify WXML, which is nothing more than an enhanced version of HTML/XML. We do not believe that for such things there should ever be a need for large teams of highly skilled technical people simply doing tasks which are mostly repetitive. Similarly custom WXML translaters/code generators can be created for any type of technological platform you use which can automate at least some of the development if not all, hence reducing the development team size. Because each project has a different technical stack, such translater/code generators would be created specifically for any customers as per their technical environment and their coding standards.
5. WX can be used to create optimized custom solutions for lightning fast real time applications as well. On need basis parts of any real time logic can be done in a C DLL or .so libraries and WX can call those libraries for superfast transactions. With a small but efficient WX server directly handling incoming traffic talking directly to a C library and with no other layers in between you can expect performance that is close to or equal to maximum physically possible on any given hardware.
6. WX can be one software for all the web based workflows within an organization eliminating the need for various different systems and integrations.
7. Typical ERP implementations are never suitable for any enterprise out of the box, and require a lot of custimizations. The end result often is a massive system that requires extensive training for users. WX has very simple WYSIWG (What You See Is What You Get) user interface and its philosophy of WYNIWYD (What Need Is What You Develop/Deploy) you end up with a smaller system which is much easier to manage and use.
8. WX can be customised or WXML can be enhanced easily by developers with knowlege of HTML/CSS and Javascript to take care of any business needs for an enterprise, regardless of features it comes out of box with.
9. WX has in built security and role based authentication which is at par with other such libraries. 
10. There is already a community of WX developers and a growing network of WX solution providers to address any business continuity concerns.

We welcome technical evaluation and benchmarking with your typical deployment for you to be able to compare the difference. Seeing is believing, so you can contact our solution providers for a demo.

Notes for Developers of Web Based Solutions
-------------------------------------------
1. WX comes with a database structure which is suitable for 90% of typical business requirements. It creates and manages the database as well as data internally with zero coding. So you only create layout on what the screen looks like and WX figures out where and how to store and retrieve the data. The standard database can be enhanced, customized or replaced altogether on need basis.
2. HTML/XML is very basic skill and it is difficult to imagine being able to build full scale solutions using WXML, a language that is nothing but new HTML tags with a syntax of XML, for developers used to complex technologies like PHP, React, Java or Angular. You can read through quick start guide quickly and if you have time try the examples in the demo to see that its actually possible.
3. To add new tags (XTENS) you simply create another WXML file and encapsulate all the HTML, CSS, browser javascript and server side javascript in a single file. So there is no need for you to go looking around where the problem is when a problem occurs. You can check out _system/xtens folder to see the XTENS currently packaged with WX and see how easy it is to enhance WXML.
4. With open source technologies or with solutions built on PHY, Python or Javascript it can be difficult to protect your source code. In WX it is possible for you to deploy an encrypted version of XTENS and/or JSON files on client server where they can run the application but cannot view or modify your source code.
5. You can develop and deploy applications quicker and build new solutions quicker and have less problems overall. Users would also like the ease of use of final outcome.
6. You only need prior knowledge or HTML and CSS to start building solutions using WXML. And you only need basic Javascript skill with understanding of underlying WX architecture to enhance WXML by creating new XTENS. There is no need for skills in any complex technologies while working with WX.

Seeing is believing, so you can contact us to see a demo and if you like you can join our network of Wohola Solution providers. Currently we have ongoing free training programs for companies or developers willing to join the Wonderful World of Wohola X. With a powerful solution like Wohola X and a network of like minded companies you end up with capability to deliver any size project with any level of complexity.

Limitations
-----------
1. Currently WX can only cater to Web Based requirements. It cannot take care of Mobile apps for the time being.
2. WX is currently restricted to a Windows Server only due to its philosophy that things should either be done automatically by the system or should be easy enough for end user. So this configuration makes it easier for even a non-technical person to learn how to manage the WX server. WX can work on Linux also and if any project requires such infrastructure it can be done for that project.
3. WX is based on licensing model. You can download and run the wx.exe freely for learning, development, testing and other such purposes using localhost. This exe would have certain issues if used to handle live domains without a license file. You can send us a message to find out more about the license file. Meanwhile you can try it out with the quick start guide in docs folder and with the demo code within this repository.
4. WX is primarily designed for software meant for business solutions only. It can be enhanced for any business needs, including Workflow management, e-commerce, websites, video/audio streaming and conferencing etc. It can also be used for backend functions and a REST API for mobile apps. WXML is not currently suitable for any code that runs only on the server or code that is not accessible via a website. It is also not suitable for operating system level development or for highly complex research based coding.
